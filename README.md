# Multilingual AI Email Reply Demo

This is a simplified demo of a multilingual AI-powered email agent, built with **FastAPI** and designed for deployment on **Vercel** using serverless functions.

It simulates the key workflow of handling customer service emails in multiple languages by:
- Translating incoming customer emails into German (internal language)
- Generating a simulated AI response in German
- Translating the response back to the original language of the customer

## âœ¨ Features

- Language detection via input
- Mock translation logic (can be extended with real APIs like DeepL or Google Translate)
- Simulated AI response generator (extendable with OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- FastAPI-based serverless function
- Ready to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Mangum (for Vercel compatibility)
- Pydantic (for request/response models)
